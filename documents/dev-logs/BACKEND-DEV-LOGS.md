# Implementation Logs

## Step 1: Project Setup and Dependencies
**Date:** 2024-07-11

- Initialized a Node.js project with `npm init -y`
- Installed required dependencies: 
  - express (web framework)
  - sequelize (ORM for MySQL)
  - mysql2 (database driver for Sequelize)
  - jsonwebtoken (JWT for authentication)
  - bcrypt (for password hashing)
  - dotenv (for configuration)
- Installed nodemon as a development dependency
- Created basic project structure with directories:
  - src/config
  - src/controllers
  - src/middlewares
  - src/models
  - src/routes
  - src/utils
- Created .env file with necessary environment variables
- Created a basic entry point file (src/index.js)
- Updated package.json with proper scripts for running the application 

## Step 2: Database Configuration
**Date:** 2024-07-16

- Created database configuration file (src/config/database.js)
- Set up Sequelize ORM with MySQL connection using environment variables
- Created models index file (src/models/index.js) to load and initialize models

  - Handle database initialization errors
- Configured database sync options to be environment-aware (development vs production) 

## Step 3: User Model
**Date:** 2024-07-17

- Created User model (src/models/User.js) with Sequelize
- Implemented essential user fields:
  - id (primary key, auto-increment)
  - username (unique, with length validation)
  - email (unique, with email validation)
  - password (with length validation)
  - isActive (boolean, default true)
  - role (enum: 'user' or 'admin', default 'user')
- Added Sequelize hooks for:
  - Password hashing before user creation
  - Password rehashing if password is changed during updates
- Implemented an instance method for password validation
- Added a placeholder for future model associations 

## Step 4: Authentication Middleware
**Date:** 2024-07-23

- Created JWT authentication middleware (src/middlewares/auth.js) to:
  - Extract JWT tokens from Authorization headers
  - Verify token authenticity using the JWT secret
  - Attach decoded user information to the request object
  - Handle missing or invalid tokens with appropriate error responses
- Implemented role-based authorization middleware (src/middlewares/authorize.js) to:
  - Restrict route access based on user roles
  - Support both single role and multiple role checks
  - Work in conjunction with the authentication middleware
- Created middlewares index file (src/middlewares/index.js) to:
  - Export all middleware functions from a central location
  - Make importing middleware functions easier in route definitions 

## Step 5: User Controller
**Date:** 2024-07-24

- Created User controller (src/controllers/userController.js) with CRUD operations:
  - getAllUsers: Retrieves all users with password excluded from response
  - getUserById: Retrieves a single user by ID with password excluded
  - updateUser: Updates user information with proper authorization checks
    - Added permission checks to prevent non-admins from modifying other users
    - Added special handling for password updates to ensure proper hashing
    - Enhanced security by restricting role updates to admin users only
  - deleteUser: Removes a user with proper authorization checks
    - Limited deletion to admins or the user themselves
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Created User routes file (src/routes/userRoutes.js) with protected endpoints:
  - GET /api/users - List all users
  - GET /api/users/:id - Get a specific user
  - PUT /api/users/:id - Update a user
  - DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete a user
- Created a placeholder Authentication controller and routes (to be fully implemented in Step 6)
- Created a routes index file to organize and export all routes
- Protected all User routes with the JWT authentication middleware 

## Step 6: Authentication Controller
**Date:** 2024-07-25

    - Added checks for existing users with the same username or email
    - Implemented secure password hashing via User model hooks
    - Generated JWT token containing user ID, username, and role
  - signin: Authenticates users and issues a JWT token
    - Supports login with either username or email
    - Validates user credentials with proper error messages
    - Checks if user account is active
    - Generates JWT token upon successful authentication
- Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Ensured proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios:

  - 200 OK for successful signin
  - 400 Bad Request for missing fields
  - 401 Unauthorized for invalid credentials
  - 403 Forbidden for inactive accounts
  - 409 Conflict for duplicate users
  - 500 Internal Server Error for server-side issues
- Utilized existing User model's password validation method for secure authentication 

## Step 7: Routes
**Date:** 2024-07-26

- Verified the proper implementation of existing route files:
  - src/routes/userRoutes.js: Protected routes for user CRUD operations
  - src/routes/authRoutes.js: Public routes for user authentication
  - src/routes/index.js: Central file to organize and export all route modules
- Ensured correct route structure and path organization:
  - User routes mounted at /api/users
  - Authentication routes mounted at /api/auth
- Updated the main application file (src/index.js) to:
  - Import the routes module
  - Register all API routes with the Express application
  - Place route registration after middleware setup but before the test route
- Confirmed proper authentication middleware usage:
  - User routes protected by JWT authentication
  - Auth routes remain public for signup and signin endpoints
- Ensured correct routing configuration to match controller methods:
  - POST /api/auth/signup → authController.signup
  - POST /api/auth/signin → authController.signin
  - GET /api/users → userController.getAllUsers
  - GET /api/users/:id → userController.getUserById
  - PUT /api/users/:id → userController.updateUser
  - DELETE /api/users/:id → userController.deleteUser 

## Step 8: Refactor: Base Repository Class
**Date:** 2024-07-27

- Created a BaseRepository class in `src/models/BaseRepository.js` with methods:
  - getAll(filter): Retrieves all records with optional filtering options
  - getById(id): Retrieves a single record by ID
  - create(data): Creates a new record
  - update(id, data): Updates a record with provided data
  - delete(id): Removes a record
- Refactored the userController to use the BaseRepository:
  - Created a userRepo instance with the User model
  - Replaced direct model method calls with repository methods
  - Updated the response handling for getById and updateUser to manually exclude password
  - Maintained all existing authorization checks and business logic
- This refactoring improves code maintainability by:
  - Abstracting common database operations into a reusable class
